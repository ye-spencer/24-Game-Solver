# How to use

## Initial download

1. Download the code an unzip it anywhere

## Running the bot

1. Run `python bot.py`
2. Wait for the window to load, and click the "Against the clock" option
3. Within 3 seconds, place your mouse slightly above and to the right of the top corner of the canvas (does not need to be exact)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Program can't be left alone, if you don't see and click the coffee breaks fast enough the program will crash

4. Once you are satisfied with your score. Open another window using your keyboard to intentionally crash the system.
 - Windows + i works well for this purpose

## Running the analysis
1. Select the test you want by uncommenting the proper test in the `main()` function in `solver.py`.
2. Run `python solver.py`
