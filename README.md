# 24-Game-Solver
This is a selenium bot that can play the game on 4nums.com and get the monthly high scores

Originally created to calculate the percent of hands that are winnable in the 24 card game.


# TO USE

1. Run python bot.py
2. Wait for the window to load
3. Once the window loads, click the "Against the clock" option
4. Within 3 seconds, place your mouse slightly above and to the right of the top corner of the canvas (does not need to be exact)
5. Enjoy!

Once you are satisfied with your score. Open another window using your keyboard to intentionally crash the system.
 - Windows + i works well for this purpose
