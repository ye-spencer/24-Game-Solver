A project is never truly done, here are some future steps that I, or anyone else, can take to improve this project

# New Features
 - Detect when automatic coffee breaks show up and click off them
 - Click the "never show solutions" button once it shows up
 - add threads to the sampling test to speed it up

# Optimizations
 - Find a better way of closing the program rather than just crashing it
 - Optimize button clicking, we currently often click a button twice because a box is already selected if it is the sum/difference/product of two numbers previously

# Bug Fixes
 - There is a few problems that are solvable that the program cannot find because of floating point errors or because of integer truncation, not too sure which one
